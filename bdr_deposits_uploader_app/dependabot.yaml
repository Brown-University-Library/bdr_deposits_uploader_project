# Basic `dependabot.yml` file with
# minimum configuration for uv package manager

# Birkin-note: I'm not sure I'm doing this right, so this is an experiment based on:
# https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates


version: 2
updates:
  # Enable version updates for uv
  - package-ecosystem: "uv"
    # Look for `uv.lock` and `pyproject.toml` files in the `root` directory
    directory: "/"
    # Check the uv registry for updates every day (weekdays)
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
