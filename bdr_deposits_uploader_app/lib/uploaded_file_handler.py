    Apparently it's good to go through the relative-path rigamarole below
    because using default_storage.save() is supposed to be good, and it needs a relative path.  ðŸ¤”

    From reading django docs, there are nice some things django automatically does
    based on the uploaded size of the file (like saving to disk or memory).
    I can't remember if those features are active here, but am using standard approaches.

    But it still feels unnecessaryily messay. TODO: review and possibly refactor.
